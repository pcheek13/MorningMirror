# Collaboration

MorningMirror welcomes contributions that keep the platform stable and easy to use. Please keep the process lightweight and focused on quality.

## Pull requests
- Open PRs against `master` with concise descriptions of the change and why it helps MorningMirror users.
- Request at least one review before merging; avoid merging your own unreviewed changes.
- Include tests or manual verification notes when applicable.

## Issues
- File issues with clear reproduction steps and platform details.
- Configuration and third-party module issues should be reproduced with the default MorningMirror setup when possible.

## Releases
Releases are cut from `master` after dependencies and documentation are up to date. Tag releases using semantic versions (for example, `v1.0.0`) and summarize the highlights in `CHANGELOG.md`.
